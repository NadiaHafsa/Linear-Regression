Linear Regression Model for Insurance Charges
This project implements a linear regression model to predict insurance charges based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region.

How to Run the Project
Open the notebook: Access the Google Colab notebook file.
Run all cells: Execute all code cells sequentially from top to bottom. This will:
Load the dataset.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the linear regression model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Generate visualizations of the results.
File Structure
/content/Insurance.csv: The dataset containing insurance information.
The project is contained within this single Google Colab notebook file.
Key Findings
Smoker Status is a Major Predictor: The analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between being a smoker and having significantly higher insurance charges.
Age and BMI also Influence Charges: Older individuals and those with higher BMI tend to have higher insurance costs, although the relationship is not as strong as with smoking status.
Model Performance: The linear regression model achieved an R-squared score of 0.78, indicating that it explains a substantial portion of the variance in insurance charges.
Model Limitations: The residuals plot suggests that the model's predictions might be less accurate for individuals with very high insurance charges.
